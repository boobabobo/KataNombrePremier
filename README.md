# KataNombrePremier

A number called prime if it is greater than 1 and cannot be written as the product of two smaller natural numbers.
1 is not a prime number and also not composite.

In this Kata, you have to write a service to define all prime numbers before a n.

exp: n = 6 => all prime numbers less then 6 are : 2, 3, 5 

Nice to have: use Java 8+
